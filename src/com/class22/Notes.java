	Car obj = new Car();
	/* Car - class name
	 * obj - Reference variable/object name
	 * = - assigning operator
	 * new - keyword that creates an object
	 * Car() - constructor - will initialize object and give default values to all 
	 *         uninitialized variables (global)
	 *       - String - null
	 *       - int - 0
	 *       - boolean - false
	 *       
	 *       *If you do not create a constructor, the compiler will create a default constructor
	 *       *If you create a constructor, the compiler will not create one for you
	 
	 *       
	 *       The main role of constructor is to initialize variables
	 *       
	 *       Cannot make a constructor as static
	 *       When we make a constructor private we can instanciate the class within itself, but would be able
	 *       to intanciate in a differnt class
	 *       
	 *       CONSTRUCTOR VS METHOD
	 *       DIFF
	 *       Constructor must be same as class, method can have any name
	 *       Constructor cannot have a return type not even void, method must have a return type
	 *       Constructor cannot be static, method can ne static or non static
	 *       Constructor is called automatically, methods need to be called
	 *       Constructor need to be defined or compiler will create one for you,methods compiler won't create
	 *       SIMILARITIES
	 *       
	 *       Both have parameters or not
	 *       Access modifiers can be used
	 *
